#### R-project: analysis of a data set

## Objective and Introduction: 
The goal of this porject is to introduce basic analytics of a data set by plotting data, setting correlation between data, write down observations/analysis and the significance of it in real life. The taken data set for examination is International Educational Costs for international students. 

## Features: 
The project was developed using R programming language, with several packages, including: dplyr - for working with data frames, manipulating and cleaning data; ggplot2 - for plotting and visualizing structured data; corrplot - for correlation analysis and setting relationships between different numer data (and for plotting as well). The project was developed in R Studio IDE. 
Overall, the porject presents the basic manipulation of data to construct visualization and make an analysis of what can be observed on graphs. This is the first personal project working directly with a given data set, using structuring of data techniques(cleaning, filtering, manipulating), visualing the results, and setting relationships. 

## Possible modifications in future? 
Most likely, this project may be modified in the future. There are 2 options: either keep working on this repisotory and make some changes, or create a different repisotory, and this is going to be a different project.
